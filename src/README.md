## Overview
This section focuses on developing and validating our LLM-powered SQL query generation system. The project uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach combined with OpenAI's models to translate natural language questions into SQL queries. Our implementation includes comprehensive validation, bias detection, and automated CI/CD pipelines.
